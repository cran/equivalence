2015-**-**  Andrew Robinson  <andrewpr@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

	* Version: 0.7

	* General: Deprecated relative intercept TOST in
	equivalence.xyplot. Corrected reported CI in tost documentation
	reported by Dr. Beate Kruger.

2014-10-21  Andrew Robinson  <andrewpr@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

	* Version: 0.6.1

	* General: Corrected error in tost.stat, pointed out by Tingting
	Zhan.

2014-06-02  Gregory Belenky <belenky@wsu.edu>

	* Version: 0.6.0

	* General: Added new robust equivalence test.

2013-10-24  Andrew Robinson  <andrewpr@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

	* Version: 0.5.7

	* General: updated for compatibility.

2010-01-05  Andrew Robinson  <andrewr@mu.ms.unimelb.edu.au>

	* Version: 0.5.6

	* equivalence.xyplot.Rd: removed unknown macro '\bar'.

2009-01-26  Andrew Robinson  <andrewr@mu.ms.unimelb.edu.au>

	* Version: 0.5.5

	* equiv.boot.Rd: removed errant space between braces.

2009-01-16  Andrew Robinson  <andrewr@mu.ms.unimelb.edu.au>

	* Version: 0.5.4

	* Rd files: replaced calls to code with verb for 2.9.x.

2008-04-16  Andrew Robinson  <andrewr@mu.ms.unimelb.edu.au>

	* Version: 0.5.3

	* equiv.boot.R: Explicitly checks that x and y are of equal length
	and stops if not.

2008-01-10  Andrew Robinson  <andrewr@mu.ms.unimelb.edu.au>

	* Version: 0.5.2

	* equiv.boot.lm.R: this function is now hidden from the user
	because people were using it instead of equiv.boot(), its wrapper.

	* equiv.boot.R: now provides an argument to express the interval
	of indifference for the intercept in the same units as the
	intercept.

2008-01-08  Andrew Robinson  <andrewr@mu.ms.unimelb.edu.au>

	* Version: 0.5.1

	* equivalence.xyplot.R: corrected the computation of the
	confidence interval of the intercept.  Previously the interval was
	computed too high.  Added options to add a smooth to the plot to
	aid interpretation, and to specify absolute or relative (to the
	estimated mean) intervals for the intercept.

	* ptte.data.R: this test no longer allows for absolute intervals
	of indifference.  Use tost() for such tests.

	* ptte.stat.R: this test no longer allows for absolute intervals
	of indifference.  Use tost.stat() for such tests.

	* tost.stat.R: this test no longer allows for relative intervals
	of indifference.  Use ptte.stat() for such tests.

2007-12-28  Andrew Robinson  <andrewr@mu.ms.unimelb.edu.au>

	* Version: 0.5.0

	* tost.R: The tost.data() function has been deprecated.  Please
	use tost, which relies in the t.test() function and its civilized
	apparatus.  The advantage is that we now accommodate pooled,
	unpooled, and paired data in the one function.

2007-12-16  Andrew Robinson  <andrewr@mu.ms.unimelb.edu.au>

	* Version: 0.4.4

	* several: Cleaned up documentation so that internal files are hidden.

2007-11-08  Andrew Robinson  <andrewr@mu.ms.unimelb.edu.au>

	* Version: 0.4.3

	* equiv.boot.R: Fixed problem in where the wrong intervals were
	being used for the slope; thanks to Michael Saunders for the bug
	report.
