	* equivalence.xyplot.R: corrected the computation of the
	confidence interval of the intercept.  Previously the interval was
	computed too high.  Added options to add a smooth to the plot to
	aid interpretation, and to specify absolute or relative (to the
	estimated mean) intervals for the intercept.

	* ptte.data.R: this test no longer allows for absolute intervals
	of indifference.  Use tost for such tests.

	* ptte.stat.R: this test no longer allows for absolute intervals
	of indifference.  Use tost.stat for such tests.

	* tost.stat.R: this test no longer allows for relative intervals
	of indifference.  Use ptte.stat for such tests.

	* tost.R: The tost.data() function has been deprecated.  Please
	use tost, which relies in the t.test() function and its civilized
	apparatus.  The advantage is that we now accommodate pooled,
	unpooled, and paired data in the one function.

	* several: Cleaned up documentation so that internal files are hidden.

	* equiv.boot.R: Fixed problem in where the wrong intervals were
	being used for the slope; thanks to Michael Saunders for the bug
	report.
