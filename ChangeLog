	* tost.R: The tost.data() function has been deprecated.  Please
	use tost, which relies in the t.test() function and its civilized
	apparatus.  The advantage is that we now accommodate pooled,
	unpooled, and paired data in the one function.

	* several: Cleaned up documentation so that internal files are hidden.

	* equiv.boot.R: Fixed problem in where the wrong intervals were
	being used for the slope; thanks to Michael Saunders for the bug
	report.
